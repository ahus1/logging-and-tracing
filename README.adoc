= Logging and tracing with Context - comparing Log4j and Zipkin

== About

This is an examples project for logging and tracing with Log4j and Zipkin.

This is an add-on to a talk I presented.

== Disclaimer

This code is presented as examples for learning and not as ready-to-use production code.

== Running the examples

During my talks I usually run the examples from my IntelliJ IDE.
Matching run configurations are part of this repository.
This makes it easy to explore and debug them.

Once the examples run you can point your browser to the following URL: http://localhost:8080/

To run the Zipkin example you'll need to have a Zipkin server up-and-running (for testing an instance started with Docker will do).

You can run the examples from the command line like this:

----
mvn -am -pl 10_simple spring-boot:run
mvn -am -pl 20_programmatic_mdc spring-boot:run
mvn -am -pl 30_interceptors spring-boot:run
mvn -am -pl 40_sleuth spring-boot:run
----

The last example runs two services on different ports in two different processes.
Therefore two commands are necessary to be run in different terminals:
----
mvn -am -pl 50_zipkin spring-boot:run
mvn -am -pl 50_zipkin spring-boot:run@run-external
----
